[View Full](http://developer.royalcanin.com/changelog.html)

 ## v6.0.0
A major version update that includes an overhaul of foundation elements; namely buttons and forms. These design and functional updates help to underpin our consistent visual identity whilst making these elements more robust and flexible for implementation, with clear new rules on aspects such as usage, interactivity and hierarchy.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Buttons
An overhaul of all button elements including styling, states, functionality as well as rules on hierarchy that help to support visual flow and create a unified consistent brand identity.
 ##### Forms
A complete overhaul of all form elements including a slicker simplified styling, alert states and functionality.
 ### New Features
 ##### Interactive Icons
Icons now have an interactive class which allows them to display a hover state within icon buttons.
 ##### Warning colour
We have added a warning colour under the tertiary pallet to support UX for form implementation and alert messages. The error colour has been updated as not to clash with the Brand1 colour.
 ### Minor updates/bug fixes
 ##### Icon colours
Update to ensure that default icons inherit the Iconography colour class.
 ## v5.1.0
A refinement on version 5 with the addition of some new hyperlink styles.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Hyperlinks
A complete overhaul of a better branded link styling with a new external link style coupled with an icon for links that generate new pages and lead to external sites; also a CTA link style for use underneath paragraph text or where additional visual attention is required.
 ##### Typography
Complete overhaul to typography styling with some additional modifier classes provided for interactive titles and the removal of legacy bold and uppercase typeface and styles.
 ### Minor updates/bug fixes
 ##### Layout container
Removed padding from single column container to enable full width display.
 ## v5.0.0
With the growing need for visual elements we've added various multimedia elements.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Colour naming conventions
We've had an overhaul of how we name our colours. They're now a lot more logical and abstract.
 ### New Features
 ##### Content Blocks
Content blocks make up a large proportion of many consumer facing websites. They are one of the most powerful assets we have to create a consistent visual style to landing pages, campaigns and content. This is why we have taken the time to carefully define and develop a collection of ready to use variations of content blocks for use across Royal Canin digital projects.
 ##### 404 template
Usual page not found but with a nice animated svg image.
 ##### Media elements
We've added an array of new media elements. Including items like the <picture> element for true responsive image and parallax media elements for when a page needs a bit of extra flare.
 ##### Responsive typography
Headings now grow/shrink depending on the device/screen sizes.
 ##### Design Language tips/alerts
We've now added tip and alerts across the Design Language to highlight important information.
 ## v4.0.0
On our quest for design system utopia we are extremely happy to announce the release of a brand new website. The new site design makes it easier to get started in design and development projects, and to find exactly what you are looking for.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Vertical Navigation
The vertical navigation component has been removed
 ### New Features

New layout and navigation structure
 ## v3.1.0
This release is all about improving our documentation. We have included a new section on implementation which we hope will clear up how to get your project up and running.
 ### New Features

A whole section dedicated to helping you get up and running with the Design Language. Including a downloadable HTML boilerplate.

 ## v3.0.0
Following the recent v2.0.0 update, in this release we give you another boat load of code optimisations on our journey to the land of implementation utopia. A 16 pixel icon set is now also a thing of beauty for design and development. We banished some bugs on responsive typography to the past amongst some other ghosts, ghouls and demons. And finally, whilst we canâ€™t help you find love, we can give you a long lost search feature to help you find what you are looking for.
 ### Breaking Changes
 ##### Form Elements Update
The "rc-" prefix has been removed from form input classes in order to be consistent with the rest of Design Language. Form elements now also follow BEM class naming convention.
